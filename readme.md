# NFT Collateralized Lending Platform

This project is a smart contract-based lending platform that allows users to use NFTs as collateral for loans. The platform enables borrowers to list their NFTs for collateral, receive loan offers from lenders, and accept the best offers. Lenders can submit loan offers with specified terms, and the platform securely manages the transfer and return of NFT collateral.

## Features

- **List NFT Collateral**: Borrowers can list their NFTs to request a loan, specifying loan amount, interest, and repayment terms.
- **Submit Loan Offers**: Lenders can make offers on NFT listings by proposing loan terms and interest rates.
- **Accept Offers**: Borrowers review and accept loan offers, which initiates a loan and transfers the NFT to the contract as collateral.
- **Secure Collateral**: NFTs are held securely by the contract until the loan is repaid or defaults.
